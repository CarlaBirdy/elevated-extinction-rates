# Elevated modern-day extinction rate estimates for vertebrates and plants in Australia
Companion repository for the analysis of "Elevated modern-day extinction rate estimates for vertebrates and plants in Australia" which will be submitted as a publication in 2022. This analysis was led by Carla Archibald and data collation was assisted by Euan Richie and Rachael Gallagher based on methods by Ceballos et al. (2015).

The source data for the described species numbers were compiled from Chapman et al. (2009), extinctions numbers were compiled from Woinarski et al. (2019) and underlying extinction rates were compiled from Barnosky, et al. (2011) for vertebrates and Humphreys, et al. (2019) for plants.

This repository contains all data, code and documentation to reproduce the:

This analysis was done as a part of the @land-use-trade-offs project.
