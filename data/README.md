# Data use to estimate the elevated modern-day extinction rate in Australia
This folder contains the input and output data use and created as a part of the elevated extinction rate analysis based on Ceballos et al. (2015). This data was compiled by Carla Archibald, Euan Richie and Rachael Gallagher.

## Input data
The source data for the described species numbers were compiled from Chapman et al. (2009), described extinction numbers were compiled from Woinarski et al. (2019) and underlying extinction rates were compiled from Barnosky, et al. (2011) for vertebrates and Humphreys, et al. (2019) for plants. For the described extinction numbers and the underlying extinction rates, we gathered a high and a low estimate to try and capture the uncertainty around these values. 

## Output data
The input data is fed into the code provided in the 'code' folder which takes data on the described species (Chapman et al. 2009), extinctions numbers (Woinarski et al. 2019) and underlying extinction rates (Barnosky, et al. 2011; Humphreys, et al. 2019), and outputs an estimate of the elevated extinction rate. We also provide code to generate figures.
